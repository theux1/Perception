        <h2>Edges, contrast and some dots</h2>
        <p>
          How do we perceive our environment? Think of our perception as a frame that moves infront of a
          background. It constantly scans for figures on a background that seem most relevant to us.
        </p>
        <div>
          <div class="margin">
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-percept-320x160.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/Perception/Desktop/Box-percept-407x186.png" alt="red circle around streets light">
            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Interesting is, that our perception leads this frame
          according to certain mechanisms. One of these
          mechanisms is, that our attention is looking for
          <span class="strong">edges</span>. Edges with clear contrast are easier to
          grasp and seperated from the background. Due to
          we are in UX, let’s make a graphic example. A dot
          can be found in the following box.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="margin">
        <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-0-320x160.svg" alt="Box with no dot inside of it">
        <p>
          Do you see the dot? It is there. Promised. If you click on it you will win a pot of gold that is waiting at the
          foot of a rainbow for you. Ok, I am not serious here. You can not see that, because the dot has the same
          colour than the background. That means, yup, I inserted a 25x25 px dot in the upper right corner no one
          can actually see (smiling sweat). Can you see the dot in the next box?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="margin">
        <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-1-320x160.svg" alt="Box with one dot inside of it">
        <p>
          This dot may be more visible to you, because it has a clear <span class="strong">contrast</span> in colour and therefore has a
          perceivable <span class="strong">edge</span>. Why you should keep on reading you ask? Well, we can add more dots if you prefer.
          Let’s add more dots. By the way, without counting, how many dots do you see in the box below?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="margin">
        <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-5-320x160.svg" alt="Box with five dots inside of it" />
        <p>
          Before you get the wrong idea, this is not a test. Our short term memory defines the amount of elements
          we can visually process at once. There are actually 5 dots inside the box above. What about now? How
          many dots are in the following box?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="margin">
        <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-6-320x160.svg" alt="Box with six dots inside of it">
        <p>
          Have you been able to tell right away or did you have to count? Though, we can easily grasp 5
          elements, most people can not instantly distinct the number of dots to be 6. They have to count. But
          what happens when we order the elements like in the next example?
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="margin">
        <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-6-dice-320x160.svg" alt="Box with six ordered dots inside of it">
        <p>
          Now the number is quicker to scan. Why? Our mind <span class="strong">groups</span> together two rows of threes. Also we have
          learned this formation of dots to be a <span class="strong">symbol</span>.That way our mind refers the information it perceives with
          information learned previously. Now this dice also displays some other parameter that make the
          difference whether we can perceive something easily or not. These parameters are: <span class="strong">Proximity</span>, <span class="strong">Contiguity</span>
          and <span class="strong">Similarity</span>. The more these elemets share those properties, the better they can be grouped.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <h2>Groups</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s move up to higher levels of the perception and memory. Elements can be grouped on all levels of the
          process. Elements in the beginning and at the end of a group stick better with the user. This is called
          ‘PIMACY’ and ‘RECENCY’. Let’s move away from the dot examples to be more practical.
        </p>
        <div>
        <img id="smiley" src="img/Perception/Mobile/Sad-smiley-38x35.svg" alt="A sad smiley face">
      </div>
      <br>
        <p>
          Imagine you want to get a message across. Let’s make the message to be 16 sentences long. 4 sentences
          of introduction, 8 sentences main section, 4 sentences conlusion, as boringly but efficiently illustrated
          below.
        </p>
        <div class="margin">
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/Perception/Mobile/message-empty-320x98.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/Perception/Desktop/message-empty-854x120.png" alt="hierarchic table">
        </picture>
      </div>
        <p>
          To understand the effect, you have to know the following: Our brain is always wired to seek for orientation.
          The less ambiguous the information is, the better for recall.<br><br>
          <span class="strong">Primacy</span>: The first sentence is not only the first of all other sentences, but also the first of the introduction
          and the first of the whole message. It is the first on all levels.
        </p>
        <div class="margin">
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/Perception/Mobile/message-border-320x98.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/Perception/Desktop/message-edge-854x120.png" alt="hierarchic table with markers">
        </picture>
      </div>
        <p>
          Therefore it shares 3 edges <span class="purple">(purple)</span>. This is easy to process for our mind, due to the unambiguaty of the
          location of information. The 5th sentence, however, has only 2 edges <span class="orange">(orange)</span> and has less properties for
          orientation. Remember, we are always seeking for orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="strong">Recency</span>: This is the same effect, only with the last element of a bulk of information.
          Studies have indeed shown, that content in the middle of a group of information is most vulnerable for
          interferences and mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t want to go into detail how powerfull this knowledge is for marketing purposes. But one hint. There
          is one really bad area for CTAs. Also the whole group should be easy to scan for orientation purposes.
