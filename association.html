          <h2>Shapes</h2>
          <p>
            Have you ever wondered why we (can) see shapes in the clouds?
            Up front. It is not, because the clouds actually resemble a shape (animal, face, ...) that much. It is because
            our mind is actively <span class="strong">looking for shapes</span> known to it, to be able <span class="strong">to make quick decisions</span>. Some say that
            is, because in the evolution of human beings, it was of advantage while we had to run away from preditor
            animals. Imagine your self stroling through the jungle, looking for a good ol’ banana tree.

            That is made possible by the associative nature of our brain. We connect things together, store them and
            retain them in situations similar. Associations have a lot to do with categories.

          <h2>Categories</h2>
          <p>We group together information and that way try to make sense out of it. This is a simplified example of
            semantic categorization.

            What if our mind is unsure about how to categorize information? Well, usually we will subconciously push the information
            into any category that seems fit (#darkpattern). Remember, <span class="strong">our mind doesn’t like ambiguity</span>. Btw, next to generalization,
            this is one of the main roots of arguments and prejudgement. We ‘need’ the information to fall into a
            category. Also, this is a source for errors and mistakes. For example, did you know?

            <p>
              That is not true. A penguine is a bird. And now I
              feel bad for saying that. I mean, just look at him. But the
              point is, that it probably took you a little longer
              than it would to figure out whether a sparrow is a
              bird. Elements within a category have a <span class="strong">‘typicallity
                gradient’</span>. The gradient will determine the
              probability of mental activation. The more
              properties an element shares with the category,
              the higher it’s typicallity gradient is. Penguines
              have a beak and wings with feathers but they can’t
              fly. When I say the word “bird”, you will more likely
              think of a sparrow than a penguine. Well, besides
              you are a penguine specialist, which leads us to
              the next mechanism. Penguine specialization ....
              Sorry I meant, Priming. (Can you figure out why this mistake happened?)

          <h2>Priming</h2>
          <p>
            Do you know that your browser is caching information to improve on speed with faster loading times? Well,
            the same does your brain, with a different physiological approach, though. It is called priming. The more
            <span class="strong">often and recent</span> a chunk of information is used, the higher the <span class="strong">probability of activation</span>. An online video
            platform is using this as a dark pattern. What it basically does, is to force some CTAs on you. They are
            structured as below.
          </p>
          <div>
            <div class="overflow">
              <div class="mt40 center col-md-6">

                  Blue is
                  your actually desired option. You will be shown this
                  CTA a couple of times. This way a person is wired
                  to associate the ‘blue’ CTA with his prefered
                  option. After some exposure, the colour logic changes.

                  The probability of clicking the undesired answer
                  rises significantly, due to the user is primed on the

          <div>
            <p>
              Priming also works with associations that are not directly mentioned. When we say “bird”, our brain not
              only activates all information for the bird category but also some information in <span class="strong">categories
                linked/associated</span> to that category. For example:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="center">
            <img id="net" src="img/Association/Mobile/net-304x382.svg" alt="associations of the term 'bird'">
          </div>
          <p>
            That effect is called <span class="strong">‘spreading activation’</span> and is not necessarily a concious process. In the illustration
            above, the association ‘flight’ is more likely than ‘airplane’, made visible by the colour intensity of the knots.
            The reason is, that depending on our past <span class="strong">experiences</span>, some associations are more likely to be activated.
          </p>
          <p>
            But also the <span class="strong">situation</span> our user is or recently has been in, has influence on the activation probability,
            regardless of whether the user is in a digital or non-digital environment. The more <span class="strong">trigger</span> there are in the
            current environment, the greater the probability of associative activation. That doesn’t mean to clutter the
            screen with triggers. They still need to be distinguishable from the background and carry importance.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why UX Design has to take the user’s situation, past experiences and mental model into account. It
            also suggests the importance of analytic services. Controlling the digital environment has an impact on the
            categories we want our users to have activated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="em">Excusion</span>: You can use associations and spreading activation yourself. Have you ever been desperately
            thinking about where you have put your keys? Just go from room to room. Triggers in the room in which
            you have actually put your keys, will significantly increase the likelihood of remembering. Try it, it works.
