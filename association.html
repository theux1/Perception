        <h2>Shapes</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why we (can) see shapes in the clouds?
          Up front. It is not, because the clouds actually resemble a shape (animal, face, ...) that much. It is because
          our mind is actively looking for shapes known to him, to be able to make quick decisions. Some say that
          is, because in the evolution of human beings, it was of advantage while we had to run away from preditor
          animals. Imagine your self stroling through the jungle, looking for a good ol’ banana tree. “Wait, is that a
          tiger?” It is better to have several false alarm than to be eaten once too many ;)

            <div>
              <p>That is made possible by the associative nature of our brain. We connect things together, store them and
                retain them in situations similar. Associations have a lot to do with categories.

         <div>
          <h2>Categories</h2>
          <p>We group together information and that way try to make sense out of it. This is a simplified example of
            semantic categorization.
          </p>

          </picture>
          <p>What if we are unsure about how to categorize information? Well, usually we will push the information 
            into any category that seems fit. Remember, our mind doesn’t like ambiguity. Btw, next to generalization,
            this is one of the main roots of arguments and prejudgement. We ‘need’ the information to fall into a
            category. Also, this is a source for errors and mistakes. For example, did you know?
          </p>
         </div>

          <div>
            <p>Do you see the dot? It is there. Promised. If you click on it you will win a pot of gold that is waiting at the
              foot of a rainbow for you. Ok, I am not serious here. You can not see that, because the dot has the same
              colour than the background. That means, yup, I inserted a 25x25 px dot in the upper right corner no one
              can actually see (smiling sweat). Can you see the dot in the next box?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-1-320x160.svg" alt="Box with one dot inside of it"/>

            </div>
            <div>
              <p>This dot may be more visible to you, because it has a clear contrast in colour and therefore has a
                perceivable edge. Why you should keep on reading you ask? Well, we can add more dots if you prefer.
                Let’s add more dots. By the way, without counting, how many dots do you see in the box below?
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-5-320x160.svg" alt="Box with five dots inside of it"/>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Before you get the wrong idea, this is not a test. Our short term memory defines the amount of elements
                  we can visually process at once. There are actually 5 dots inside the box above. What about now? How
                  many dots are in the following box?
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
              <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-6-320x160.svg" alt="Box with six dots inside of it"/>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p>Have you been able to tell right away or did you have to count? It seems like we can easily grasp 5
                    elements. Most people can not instantly distinct the number of dots to be 6. They have to count. But
                    what happens when we order the elements like in the next example?
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Box-6-dice-320x160.svg" alt="Box with six ordered dots inside of it"/>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <p>Now the number is quicker to scan. Why? Our mind groups together two rows of threes. Also we have
                      learned this formation of dots to be a symbol.That way our mind refers the information it perceive with
                      information learned previously. Now this dice also displays some other parameter that make the the
                      differnce whether we can perceive something easily or not. These parameters are: Proximity, Contiguity
                      and Similarity. The more these elemets share those properties, the better they can be grouped.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <h2>Groups</h2>
                    <p>Let’s move up to higher levels of the perception and memory. Elements can be grouped on all levels of the
                      process. Those elements in the beginning and at the end of a group stick better with the user. This is called
                      ‘PIMACY’ and ‘RECENCY’. Let’s move away from the dot examples to be more practical.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/Perception/Mobile/Sad-smiley-38x35.svg" alt="Box with no dot inside of it"/>
                    <p>Imagine you want to get a message across. Let’s make the message to be 16 sentences long. 4 sentences
                      of introduction, 8 sentences main section, 4 sentences conlusion, as boringly but efficiantly illustrated
                      below.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                    </picture>
                      <p>To understand the effect, you have to know the following: Our brain is always wired to seek for orientation.
                        The less ambiguous the information is, the better for recall.
                        Primacy: The first sentence is not only the first of all other sentences, but also the first of the introduction
                        and the first of the whole message. It is the first on all levels.
                      </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <picture>

                    </picture>
                      <p>Therefore it shares 3 edges (purple). This is easy to process for our mind, due to the unambiguaty of the
                        location of information. The 5th sentence, however, has only 2 edges (orange) and has less properties for
                        orientation. Remember, we are always seeking for orientation.
                      </p>
                  </div>

                  <div>
                    <p>Recency: This is the same effect, only with the last element of a bulk of information.
                      Studies have indeed shown, that content in the middle of a group of information is most vulnerable for
                      inferences and mistakes. </p>
                    <p>I don’t want to go into detail how powerfull this knowledge is for marketing purposes. But one hint. There
                      is one really bad area for CTAs. Also the whole group should be easy to scan for orientation purposes.</p>
