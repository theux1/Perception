        <h2>Shapes</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered why we (can) see shapes in the clouds?
          Up front. It is not, because the clouds actually resemble a shape (animal, face, ...) that much. It is because
          our mind is actively looking for shapes known to him, to be able to make quick decisions. Some say that
          is, because in the evolution of human beings, it was of advantage while we had to run away from preditor
          animals. Imagine your self stroling through the jungle, looking for a good ol’ banana tree. “Wait, is that a
          tiger?” It is better to have several false alarm than to be eaten once too many ;)

          That is made possible by the associative nature of our brain. We connect things together, store them and
          retain them in situations similar. Associations have a lot to do with categories.

        <h2>Categories</h2>
        <p>We group together information and that way try to make sense out of it. This is a simplified example of
          semantic categorization.

        <p>
          What if we are unsure about how to categorize information? Well, usually we will push the information
          into any category that seems fit. Remember, our mind doesn’t like ambiguity. Btw, next to generalization,
          this is one of the main roots of arguments and prejudgement. We ‘need’ the information to fall into a
          category. Also, this is a source for errors and mistakes. For example, did you know?

        <h2>A penguine is not a bird!</h2>
        <div>
          <img id="notabird" src="img/Association/Mobile/pengu-140x151.svg" alt="cute penguine">
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            That is not true. A penguine is a bird. And now I
            feel bad for saying that. I mean, just look at him. But the
            point is, that it probably took you a little longer
            than it would to figure out whether a sparrow is a
            bird. Elements within a category have a ‘typicallity
            gradient’. The gradient will determine the
            probability of mental activation. The more
            properties an element shares with the category,
            the higher it’s typicallity gradient is. Penguines
            have a beak and wings with feathers but they can’t
            fly. When I say the word “bird”, you will more likely
            think of a sparrow than a penguine. Well, besides
            you are a penguine specialist, which leads us to
            the next mechanism. Penguine specialization ....

        <h2>Priming</h2>
        <p>
          Do you know that your browser is caching information to improve on speed with faster loading times? Well,
          the same does your brain, with a different physiological approach, though. It is called priming. The more
          often and recent a chunk of information is used, the higher the probability of activation.An online video
          platform is using this as a dark pattern. What it basically does, is to force some CTAs on you. They are
          structured as below.
        </p>
        <div>
          <div>

              Blue is
              your actually desired option. You will be shown this
              CTA a couple of times. This way a person is wired
              to associate the ‘blue’ CTA with his prefered
              option. After some exposure, the colour logic changes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/Association/Mobile/darkpattern-B-280x100.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

              <br>
              The probability of clicking the undesired answer
              rises significantly, due to the user is primed on the
              colour and location of the blue link.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Priming also works with associations that are not directly mentioned. When we say “bird”, our brain not
          only activates all information for the bird category but also some information in categories
          linked/associated to that category. For example:
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="center">
          <img id="net" src="img/Association/Mobile/net-304x382.svg" alt="associations of the term 'bird'">
        </div>
        <p>
          That effect is called ‘spreading activation’ and is not necessarily a concious process. In the illustration
          above, the association ‘flight’ is more likely than ‘airplane’, made visible by the colour intensity of the knots.
          The reason is, that depending on our past experiences, some associations are more likely to be activated.
        </p>
        <p>
          But also the situation our user is or recently has been in, has influence on the activation probability,
          regardless of whether the user is in a digital or non-digital environment. The more trigger there are in the
          current environment, the greater the probability of associative activation. That doesn’t mean to clutter the
          screen with triggers. They still need to be distinguishable from the background and carry importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why UX Design has to take the user’s situation, past experiences and mental model into account. It
          also suggests the importance of analytic services. Controlling the digital environment has an impact on the
          categories we want our users to have activated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excusion: You can use associations and spreading activation yourself. Have you ever been desperately
          thinking about where you have put your keys? Just go from room to room. Triggers in the room in which
          you have actually put your keys, will significantly increase the likelihood of remembering. Try it, it works.
