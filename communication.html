        <h2>Sender and receiver</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the nature of communication, especially the quirks of asynchroneous communication, will
          help us improve the relation to our users and bring across a message, as well as interpreting feedback.This
          is important, because not always are the information sender and receiver talking about the same content
          as they might think. Also, there are more levels of communication than the simple factual one. This is the
          reason why some machines are still struggling with it. And it keeps happening.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>As with perception, let’s start on a relatively low level of communication. Terms.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>What are terms?</h2>
        <p>Imagine, you see an unknown object. For example something like this:</p>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/Communication/Mobile/curtainfalls-320x314.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/Communication/Desktop/curtain.854x477.png" alt="apple behind curtain animation">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <p>
          Ok, hopefully this is not an unknown object. But let’s assume we see this object for the first time. We now
          have a mental representation of it in our mind. To this representation we can then learn a substitution for
          the object. In this case the term ‘apple’.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="img/Communication/Mobile/apple=object-268x131.svg" alt="'apple' equals an apple">
        </div>
        <p>
          Now we can use the word apple instead of the actual object. That’s good, because this way, we don’t have to carry
          around an apple or a picture of an apple if we want to refer to it. We can simply use the substitute:
        </p>
        <div>
          <p>apple</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Language excells information exchange. Throughout history the speed of information exchange had a
          great, if not the greatest, impact on technological and social development. But every human being has
          different experiences. That is why each person connotates terms differently than others. This leads to
          ambiguity (oh oh, if you have read the perception page, you know that our brain will simply put the terms
          into the next fitting category).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>Experiences, situation and expectation</h2>
        <p>What do we mean by saying, that someone spilled the beans?</p>
        <div>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/Communication/Mobile/spilling-beans-320x117.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/Communication/Desktop/spilling-beans-854x288.png" alt="spilled beans next to a person whispering into another's ear">
          </picture>
        </div>
        <p>Is it A: The metaphor of sharing a secret, or B: Actually spilling beans out of a container. </p>
        <p>And now it gets tricky. Not only can the meaning of the content vary depending on the experiences we have
          and the situations we are in, but also what expectations we might have towards the information sender. To
          have a better grip on that, theories like the ‘Communication Model of Schulz von Thun’ have been
          developed.
        </p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Actually, this is a problem well known to linguistic
              philosophy. More recently authors like Quine and
              Kripke have dedicated themselves to the issue of
              ‘reference’ of ideoms and terms. Each person has
              different experiences and therefore has different
              associations (or connotations) with individual
              emotional values for these. Additionally people
              may have different factual concepts of a term,
              because of differences in semantic knowledge.

      <div>
        <div>
          <h2>Semantic knowledge</h2>
          <p>A common example is the concept of ‘money’. Two people may think of ‘money’ differently.</p>
          <div>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="img/Communication/Mobile/money-300x150.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
              <img src="img/Communication/Desktop/money-854x235.png" alt="term tree about concepts of money">
            </picture>
          </div>
          <p>One may speak of money as cash money the other may imply something more complex with more differentiation.</p>
          <p>
            Every concept can be subcategoriezed or in contrary put into a higher category. For instance, cash is a
            subcategory of money and itself subsummizes coins and bills. If we narrow a concept, we speak of
            typecasting. If we widden the focus, we speak of generalization (move up a category). In the image below
            we see knots of factual knowledge (orange dots). These kots are associated with each other within a
            concept.
          </p>
          <div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Is there a limit in categorization? System theory
                suggest this to be a system with endless
                possibilities. Generalization is a powerful tool, if
                you want to avoid giving a concrete answer. It is
                most useful in politics ;) (JK)
                <br>
                Also interesting: The less someone know about a
                concept/category, the more competent he feels
                about it. In other words: You can’t know, what you
                don’t know.
                <br>
                Also, the more emotional a concept is, the more
                likely it is to generalize in need to simplify. Or do
                we really believe driving a big car will bring
                executive powers to us? It might, though, if enough
                people believe in that. Actually, that is what we call
                good marketing.
